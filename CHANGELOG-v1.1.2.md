# AI SEO Content Generator v1.1.2

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### Changes in v1.1.2:

✅ **1. Smart Engine Switching**
- When you change AI Engine (e.g., ChatGPT → Claude), it now:
  - Prompts you before clearing the API key
  - Clears the API key field (different engines need different keys)
  - Updates the Model dropdown to show correct models
  - Selects the recommended model for that engine
  - Shows a helpful notice reminding you to enter the new API key

**Example:**
- Switch from ChatGPT to Claude
- Popup asks: "Switching AI engines will clear your API key. Continue?"
- If yes: API key clears, Model dropdown shows Claude models
- Notice appears: "Switched to Claude (Anthropic). Please enter your API key and save settings."

✅ **2. Collapsible Popup Prompts**
- All 6 prompts in the popup are now in collapsible sections
- Click to expand/collapse each prompt
- Focus Keyword is open by default, others are collapsed
- Much cleaner, less overwhelming interface
- Each section has an emoji icon for easy identification:
  - 📌 Focus Keyword
  - 📝 Title
  - 📄 Short Description
  - 📃 Full Description
  - 🔍 Meta Description
  - 🏷️ Tags

**Before:** Huge popup with 6 open textareas (hard to scroll)
**After:** Compact popup, expand only what you need
